{"id":"morphir-rust-y0l","title":"Fix failing Gleam binding acceptance tests","description":"Several Gleam binding acceptance tests are failing and have been marked as @wip (work in progress):\n\n## Failing Tests\n\n### 1. Roundtrip Tests (roundtrip.feature)\n- **order_validation** scenario - Parser fails on generated function signatures with tupled arguments\n- **order_processing** scenario - Same parser issue with function signatures\n\n### 2. CLI Integration Tests (cli.feature)\n- All CLI tests - Require full CLI functionality to be implemented\n\n### 3. Project Parsing Tests (project.feature)\n- Module name lookup uses full path instead of module name (e.g., looking for 'main' but stored as 'src/main')\n\n### 4. Workspace Tests (workspace.feature)\n- Workspace parsing not yet implemented\n\n### 5. Code Generation Tests (codegen.feature)\n- Code generation steps not yet implemented\n\n## Root Causes\n\n1. **Roundtrip failures**: The Gleam parser generates function signatures with tupled parameters like `fn(#(a, b))` but cannot parse them back. The signature should be `fn(a, b)` or handle tupled parameters correctly.\n\n2. **Project parsing**: Module names need to be derived from the file path relative to src/, not include the full path or 'src/' prefix.\n\n3. **CLI/Workspace/Codegen**: These features are not yet implemented.\n\n## Impact\nBlocking full roundtrip testing for complex business logic fixtures.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-24T11:30:03.083133986-06:00","created_by":"damian","updated_at":"2026-01-24T11:30:13.91608221-06:00"}
