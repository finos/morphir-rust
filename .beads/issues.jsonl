{"id":"morphir-rust-72s","title":"Implement Python binding using Ruff parser crate","description":"Create a morphir-python-binding crate that uses Ruff's parser and AST crates to parse Python source code and convert it to Morphir IR.\n\n## Background\n\nRuff is a fast Python linter and formatter written in Rust. It provides high-quality parser and AST crates that can be reused:\n- `ruff_python_parser` - Python parser\n- `ruff_python_ast` - Python AST types\n\n## Goals\n\n1. Create `morphir-python-binding` crate following the same pattern as `morphir-gleam-binding`\n2. Use Ruff's parser crate for parsing Python source files\n3. Transform Ruff's Python AST to Morphir IR\n4. Support Python type hints for type information extraction\n5. Enable roundtrip testing (Python → IR → Python)\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **Performance**: Ruff's parser is highly optimized Rust code\n- **Correctness**: Well-tested parser used in production by the Ruff project\n- **Compatibility**: Supports modern Python syntax (3.7+)\n- **Maintenance**: Parser updates come from active Ruff development\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. Add ruff_python_parser and ruff_python_ast as dependencies\n2. Create Python AST to ModuleIR visitor\n3. Implement type annotation parsing for function signatures\n4. Add BDD acceptance tests with Python fixtures\n5. Support Python project parsing (multiple modules)\n\n## References\n\n- Ruff GitHub: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff\n- ruff_python_parser crate: https://crates.io/crates/ruff_python_parser\n- ruff_python_ast crate: https://crates.io/crates/ruff_python_ast","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-24T11:35:28.092178725-06:00","created_by":"damian","updated_at":"2026-01-24T11:35:39.738018531-06:00"}
{"id":"morphir-rust-y0l","title":"Fix failing Gleam binding acceptance tests","description":"Several Gleam binding acceptance tests are failing and have been marked as @wip (work in progress):\n\n## Failing Tests\n\n### 1. Roundtrip Tests (roundtrip.feature)\n- **order_validation** scenario - Parser fails on generated function signatures with tupled arguments\n- **order_processing** scenario - Same parser issue with function signatures\n\n### 2. CLI Integration Tests (cli.feature)\n- All CLI tests - Require full CLI functionality to be implemented\n\n### 3. Project Parsing Tests (project.feature)\n- Module name lookup uses full path instead of module name (e.g., looking for 'main' but stored as 'src/main')\n\n### 4. Workspace Tests (workspace.feature)\n- Workspace parsing not yet implemented\n\n### 5. Code Generation Tests (codegen.feature)\n- Code generation steps not yet implemented\n\n## Root Causes\n\n1. **Roundtrip failures**: The Gleam parser generates function signatures with tupled parameters like `fn(#(a, b))` but cannot parse them back. The signature should be `fn(a, b)` or handle tupled parameters correctly.\n\n2. **Project parsing**: Module names need to be derived from the file path relative to src/, not include the full path or 'src/' prefix.\n\n3. **CLI/Workspace/Codegen**: These features are not yet implemented.\n\n## Impact\nBlocking full roundtrip testing for complex business logic fixtures.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-24T11:30:03.083133986-06:00","created_by":"damian","updated_at":"2026-01-24T11:30:13.91608221-06:00"}
